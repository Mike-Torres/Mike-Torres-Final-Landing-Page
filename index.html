				<h2>Why do I love being a Developer?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>When I found out that ninja's weren't a thing anymore, and cavemen weren't taken seriously, I had to go
				to my backup plan. I figured, I was pretty good in math and wanted to
				learn to build things. When I was younger, I loved building legos into awesome 3-D Super Mario
				Characters
				and when I found out that I could create the same type of projects by coding I was sold. It started when
				I created Tetris, but not any old Tetris
				in JavaScript. I built a Tetris game that ran within the GameBoy I created. I figured if you're going to
				build an old school game,
				you have to build it the right way!
				<br><br>
				The main reason why I love this is because there is so much to learn in software programming. There will
				never be a day as a programmer
				where I will ever say I know it all and for me to be able to continually learn new technologies is one
				of the funnest things anyone can do.

					<p>This is a website I have created for a semi-professional league in Orlando, Florida. The players
						range in skill levels where
						the league leaders have created a systematic way to involve all levels of play to make it even.

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Torres/js-tetris">GameBoy Tetris!</a></h3>
					<p>If anyone had fun creating this, it was definitely me. It took me quite a while to make the game
						that I wanted.
						That was the beauty of this project. I wanted to relive a moment in my life that made me happy
						and by creating this
						I didn't even consider work. I had so much fun going through all of the bugs and figuring them
						out. This was my introduction
						to software programming.

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Torres/JS-Calculator">JavaScript Calculator</a></h3>
					<p>This project showed me how to use MVC.(Model, View, Control) It was much a different set up than
						my other applications because I was using a new conceptual idea.
						This application ended up turning out exactly how I wanted to from rendering the view to being
						able to add on enventually as I would like to turn this into a TI-84/more advanced calculator

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Torres/Twitter-ShowCase-FeedApp-Angular">Tweet App! Still in Progress</a></h3>
					<p>The application was developed to stronger understanding with connecting to large enterprise level
						API's. This application is calling information from the twitter API
						using node.js as a backend and using Angular with typescript on the front end to show all of the
						information that is being called. You can find any tweet, twitter user and the most
						popular tweets. <br><br> Technologies:
