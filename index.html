				<h2>Why do I love being a Developer?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>When I found out that ninja's weren't a thing anymore and cavemen weren't taken seriously I had to go
				to my backup plan. I figured I was pretty good in math and wanted to
				learn to build things. When I was younger, I loved building legos into awesome 3-D Super Mario
				Characters
				and when I found out that I could create the same type of projects by coding I was sold. It started when
				I created Tetris but not any old Tetris
				in JavaScript. I built a Tetris game that ran within the GameBoy I created. I figured if you're going to
				build an old school game you have to build it the right way!
				<br><br>
				The main reason why I love this is because there is so much to learn in software programming. There will
				never be a day as a programmer
				where I will ever say I know it all and for me to be able to continually learn new technologies is one
				of the funnest things anyone can do.

					<p>This is a website I have created for a semi-professional league in Orlando, Florida. The players
						range in skill levels where
						the league leaders have created a systematic way to involve all levels of play to make it even.

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Torres/js-tetris">GameBoy Tetris!</a></h3>
					<p>If anyone had fun creating this, it was definitely me. It took me quite a while to make the game
						that I wanted.
						That was the beauty of this project. I wanted to relive a moment in my life that made me happy
						and by creating this
						I didn't even consider work. I had so much fun going through all of the bugs and figuring them
						out. This was my introduction
						to software programming.

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Torres/JS-Calculator">JavaScript Calculator</a></h3>
					<p>This project showed me how to use MVC.(Model, View, Control) It was set up differently than
						my other applications because I was using a new conceptual model. (MVC)
						This application ended up turning out exactly how I wanted it to. This project was fun because it was deceptively tricky.  
						Truly grew my understanding of vanilla javascript.
						This will eventually be made into a TI-84 calculator.

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mike-Torres/Twitter-ShowCase-FeedApp-Angular">Tweet App! Still in Progress</a></h3>
					<p>This application was to develop my understanding of an enterprise framework which was Angular as well as being able to use node.js to connect to
						API's. The reason why I created the tweet app was because the documentation of twitter is one of the toughest to get through as well as able to pull from. 
						For example, to grab specified information from the twitter website you need an access token as well as credentials to access the information.  Also, using axios during 
						this project made it more difficult but really fun because I had to create everything from scratch.  This is by far the funnest project I have worked on 
						because of the promise system that axios uses and it has given me true understanding of how closures and promises are supposed to work.
